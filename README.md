Introduction
------------

A collection of programs that are "fun" in some sense and mathematical.
 

Contents
--------

* fractals.cpp -- Mandelbrot and Julia Set generator.
* ptriples.cpp -- A simple program that generates Pythagorean triples.
* ptuples.cpp -- A simple program that generates Pythagorean N-tuples.  (Use ptriples for 3-tuples as it is much faster.)
* Experimental/qkptuples.cpp -- A probably not too useful experiment to quickly produce SOME Pythagorean N-tuples.
